<div align="center">
React-based organizational structure component for organizing containers and vtc's. Provides users with a visual of their network and allows them to organize it to their needs.
</div>

## üç≠ Characteristics
- Drag & Drop the position of container and vtc nodes.
- Add, Edit, Delete implementations
- Delete 
	- Delete Node (connects children nodes with the grandparent node)
	- Delete Subtree
	- Delete Node & Subtree
- Easy to use and scalable.
- Customizable location change rules.
- Customizable node views.



## üì¶ Installation & Setup
```bash
$ git clone http://10.100.0.1/aserna/rc-org-chart.git
$ cd rc-org-chart
$ yarn install
```

- Make sure service-prov API is running on http://127.0.0.1:3004/ (Can be adjusted in Actions.js file to the `url` constant).
- Grab the authentication token from the API and apply it in the Actions.js file (src/actions/Actions.js) to the `AUTH_TOKEN` constant.

```
$ yarn start
```

- Open a browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/GraphDemo

## üî® Errors that may appear on start-up

1. If nothing appears or `Could not find "store" in the context of "Connect(GraphDemo)"` , double check the router.js file (src/pages/router.js) and make sure that following code is in the imports: 
*note: this file is considered a hidden file so you may have to make your OS make [hidden files visible](https://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/)*
```
...
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from '../../store';
```

and the `RouterWrapper` function at the bottom of the file looks like this:
```
...
export  default  function  RouterWrapper(props  =  {})  {
	return (
		<Provider  store={store}>
			<Router  history={history}>
				{renderRoutes(routes,  props)}
			</Router>
		</Provider>
	);
}
```
Save and Reload the application.
***important note**: For some reason, every time you run `yarn start` it removes these two things so you may be doing this multiple times*

2.  If nothing appears, or you get a `TLS handshake error from [::1]:61232: remote error: tls: unknown certificate`, or you get a certification error from the console, make sure to visit the service-prov API's documentation page (found in the url where you're running the service-prov API) and 'proceed anyway' on the certification warning page. Reload the application.

3.  `TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` - Application is not receiving containers, therefore the AUTH_TOKEN is most likely not correct. Save and Reload the application.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data | Organizational structure data (required and each data must have a unique id) | array | [ ] |
| pan | Whether the layer is allowed to drag | boolean | true |
| zoom | Whether the layer allows zooming | boolean | true |
| draggable | Whether the node allows drag and drop | boolean | true |
| maxZoom | Layer maximum magnification | Integer | 2 |
| minZoom | Layer reduction ratio | Integer | 0.5 |
| zoomStep | Scaling range | Integer | 2 |
| customDrag | The user can formulate a node drag and drop rule according to specific data fields and business scenarios, and return true to allow the drag node to be added to the drop node. | (dropProps, dragProps) => true | true |
| nodeRender | User-defined node rendering | props => <div style="background:#999">{props.name}</div> |  |
| extraRender | Custom rendering at the bottom of the node | props => <div style="background:#999">{props.name}</div> |  |


## ‚ùóÔ∏è Known Bugs
- Not all the functions work for the Customer node
	- Add works
	- I assume it has to do with it being a Customer object and not necessarily just a container object
- Deleting a VTC responds with an error message, however it still deletes the VTC (most likely a problem with the service-prov API)
- - While editting a container, if you change its type (user/container) AND its name, the children will disappear
